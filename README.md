### Goals of the project
- Develop a Library Manager to unite Open Source EDA tools into a flow.
- Provide similar Library Manager functionality to the ones provided by to commercial companies.
- Design User Interface in a way the users got used to.
- Make it easily customizable and extendable based on user requests/preferences.

### Top Features
LibMan helps to organize libraries and cell views in a design project:
- Create new libraries in your directories.
- Copy data into libraries.
- Delete libraries.
- Rename libraries, cells, views.
- Edit libraries, cells, and views.
- Organize cells into categories.
- Unite libraries into groups.
- Display libraries, cells, views information.
- Navigate through libraries, cells, views.

### Project file support

- Project file is used to specify and store the location of the reference and design libraries
- LibMan displays the libraries, categories, cells, and views specified in project file
- Project file can be loaded by
-- Explicitly specifying it as command line argument
-- Running LibMan from a folder where project file is saved
-- Loading from the recent file menu

Example of project file:

  GROUP Text test1 test2  
  PROJECT test1 ~/test1
  PROJECT test2 ~/test2   
  
 Where 
 - GROUP is used to unite libraries (if desiered).
 - PROJECT specifies name of the library and its location.

### Building requirements
- GCC version of 4.8.5 (or later)
- Qt version of 4.8.6 upwards
- QtCreator version of 4.0.3 (or later)
- Doxygen version of 1.8.5 (or later)

### Building project
```bash
qmake libman.pro
make
```

### Building project with QtCreator

1. Open QtCreator and go to "Tools > Options > Kits"
2. Go to "Qt Versions" add press "Add" - select the qmake executable generated by the configure script. Then hit "Apply".
3. Go to "Kits" and press "Add" - Make shure to select the correct compilers and debugger and select the previously create "Qt Version". Press "Ok".
4. Open the top level libman.pro file in QtCreator and choose the previously created Kit. QtCreator will now use the correct qmake executable.
5. Run building button to compile the project.

### Roadmap

- Provide arguments support to exectute view editors (Q4 2023)
- Git support for design data in LibMan (2024)
